gdx-tilemap3d
=============

A work-in-progress library to handle management and rendering of a game world composed of 3D "tiles" arranged in a
uniform 3D grid. Tiles can be composed of just simple 1x1x1 cubes or separate models scaled, rotated, and/or combined
at runtime to arrive at a final Tile model mesh.

**This library is still _very much_ a work in progress!**
